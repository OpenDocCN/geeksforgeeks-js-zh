**什么是打字稿？**

TypeScript 是 JavaScript 的超集，JavaScript 是一种静态聚合语言，用于编写直截了当的 JavaScript 代码。TypeScript 提供了任意的静态组合、类和接口，并且被认为具有更好的代码组织和对象排列编程过程。同样，TypeScript 考虑了更好的先进时间设备支持，并可以将语言扩展到标准装饰器之外。此外，很明显，它倾向于变成普通的 JavaScript。

TypeScript 被描绘成一个严格的 JavaScript 超集，它添加了任意的静态组合和基于类的项目排列编程，与 ECMAScript 6 标准命题一致。它被整合到一个非正式的 JavaScript 中，不需要任何运行时库来帮助它。

**这种描述代表了两个主要的脚本计划目标，它们是:**

*   Static differentiation may be a wrong construction.
*   Give a larger part of the code an organizational component.

**Typescript 的优点**

*   TypeScript is characterized by errors in layout, while JavaScript is wrong at runtime.
*   TypeScript provides the advantages of free static composition: TS types can be added to factors, capacities, attributes, etc.
*   TypeScript specifically supports static typesetting. Static combination is valuable to help archive capacity, explain utilization rate and reduce psychological overhead (interface type clues and continuous programming to get expected errors).
*   TypeScript runs in any program or JavaScript motor.
*   The extraordinary tool of intelligent perception, as a supplement to the code, provides dynamic clues.
*   TypeScript is helpful for code organization.
*   TypeScript has the idea of a namespace by characterizing a module.
*   TypeScript can be interpreted at discretion.
*   TypeScript supports interfaces.
*   The manager module of TypeScript stands out from the insights of other IDE engineers.
*   TypeScript has better documentation for APIs that are in harmony with source code. Some organizations reported that bugs were reduced when they switched to TypeScript.

**TypeScript 的缺点**

*   TypeScript has set aside a long time to integrate the code.
*   TypeScript does not support theoretical courses.
*   When using an external library, there should be a definition document, and it is often inaccessible.
*   The nature of the definition document is worrying.
*   Whenever you need to run TypeScript in your program, now there should even be a collection step to change TypeScript to JavaScript.
*   Registering a typing script engineer may be a real annoyance, because some designers are not keen on learning typing scripts and can use JavaScript. So far, people who use JavaScript have become profitable through TypeScript after about 2-3 months, and they are proficient in TypeScript only after about most of a year. Therefore, guiding employees may also be an obstacle.
*   TypeScript is not fully coexpressed with JavaScript. The missing highlights include: HOFs, Composition, and high-key generics.
